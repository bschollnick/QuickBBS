Semantic Web Paths - 

i.e. 	www.examples.com/albums/test_folder/1	 - Display Page 1 items in test_folder
	www.examples.com/albums/test_folder/1/15 - item # 15 from Page 1 in test_folder
	www.examples.com/albums/test_folder/1/6/1 - item # 6 from test_folder, page 1, is presumably
				an archive file.  This will display page #1 of the archive.
	www.examples.com/albums/test_folder/1/6/1/8 - item # 6 from test_folder, page 1, is presumably
				an archive file.  This will display item #8 from page #1 of the archive.

Disadvantage is that you can’t have a file that is only a numeric name.  

i.e. 4

But 4.zip would work, as well as zip4 or 4zip.  A purely numeric name is reserved for the semantic
URLs.

If the last item in the URL is a integer (only an integer) that is the page number to fetch.  Please note, only an integer, so a composite (page-44, page44, 44page, folder2) do not count.

Conventions - 


Consider adding - 

?ots=xyz	    -> One time sort.  Give internal validation to the sort method 
			so if the client reloads the page, and the sort scheme has been
			changed, it will use the “proper” sort scheme
