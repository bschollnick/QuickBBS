Switch to Semantic Web style page numbers?

i.e. 	www.examples.com/albums/test_folder/4
	www.examples.com/albums/test_folder/56

If the last item in the URL is a integer (only an integer) that is the page number to fetch.  Please note, only an integer, so a composite (page-44, page44, 44page, folder2) do not count.
