A Modern re-interpretation of the QuickBBS Bulletin Board software


I have considered revisiting the old QuickBBS Bulletin Board software, but with the rise of the internet, 
I have never been able to justify it.  I have never seen a advantage a telnet based BBS versus a modern
web based forum.  Or a simple web server.

But I have been working on some personal projects lately, which I am considering combining into a 
re-imagined version of QuickBBS, using modern web based technology.
