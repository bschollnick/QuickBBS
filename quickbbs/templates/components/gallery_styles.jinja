  MOVED: This file has been relocated to /Volumes/C-8TB/gallery/quickbbs/Docs/gallery_styles_reference.jinja

  Why: This component is not actively included in templates. It serves as documentation
  and reference material, so it has been moved to the Docs directory to avoid confusion.

  Current Architecture:
  - Gallery listing templates (gallery_listing_images.jinja, search_listings_images.jinja)
    contain their own inline <style> blocks
  - Item view templates (gallery_htmx_sidebar.jinja) contain their own inline <style> blocks
  - Each template is self-contained with only the styles it needs

  For the complete gallery styles reference, see:
  /Volumes/C-8TB/gallery/quickbbs/Docs/gallery_styles_reference.jinja
